# FileMaker Custom Functions

These are the standard custom functions that I generally import into all of my FileMaker projects. They represent a library
of custom functions, some commonly used, others more esoteric.

## Standards

These custom functions strive to conform to the following standards. Not all do yet, but I hope to correct the shortcomings
in the near future.

### Dividers

These custom functions are divided into groups. Since FileMaker doesn't (yet) offer folders within the custom function
dialog box, the grouping occures with two kludges. First, there is one custom function for each group that acts solely
as a heading. Second, each group is signified with a four-letter prefix unique to the group.

Headers begin with the four-letter prefix, followed by five underscores, the group name, appended with underscores to
provide a sufficient dividing line when the Function Name column of the custom function dialog is widened to a fair
width. This leads to custom function headers named like the following:

    appl_____ Application Functions ___________________________________
    devp_____ Developer _______________________________________________
    lsts_____ Lists ___________________________________________________

### Normal Functions

Normal custom functions start with the four-letter prefix, followed by a dot, and then a descriptive name in `CamelCase`,
which is how FileMaker's built-in functions are named. Some examples follow.

    date.BusinessDays
    devp.IsDeveloper
    dict.Add
    lsts.RemoveDuplicates

### Wrapped Recursive Functions

If a function's sole purpose is to act as a recursive tool for a wrapper function, in which case it is only every called
by the wrapper function, then the recursive tool is named identically to the wrapper function but with an appended
underscore.

    lsts.Concat
    lsts.Concat_
    prtf.PortalFilterCreator
    prtf.PortalFilterCreator_

### Parameters

Parameters are named in `snake_case`, but with a leading underscore, as in `_list` and `_folder_path`.

### Preamble

Each custom function starts with a preamble that looks like the following:

    // Temmplate
    //
    // Purpose:	description
    // Parameters:	  _param_1: description
    //              	_param_2: description
    //
    // Requirements: requirements
    //
    // Author:		Charles Ross
    // Version:	  1.0 written 15-03-07
    //
    // Notes:		Notes
    //
    // Example:
    // sample = result

The template is what would normall show between FileMaker's parameter list and the custom function code. For example, if
there was a function actually called template and it actually took two parameters as above, the template line would have
`Template ( _param_1; _param_2 )`.

The example portion should be something that, once the custom function has been defined, would allow a developer to copy
and paste into the data viewer, remove the commenting and have it return `True`. An example, using one of FileMaker's
built-in functions, might be `Middle ( "abc"; 2; 1 ) = "a"`. If multiple examples are included, use a single calculation
that uses a boolean `and` to create the truth statement. If the test is trivial because a constant is being returned,
this can be omitted.

If the function depends on any other custom functions, these dependencies should be documented in the requirements
section.
