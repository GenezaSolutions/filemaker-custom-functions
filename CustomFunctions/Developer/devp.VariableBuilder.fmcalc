// A feature of this system is the assigning of global variables of numerous
//   types (graphics, tool tips, etc.) from records within fields. Each record
//   is given a name and each table of global variables has a table code
//   indicating which type of variable it is. Given these two pieces of
//   information, this function builds the variable name.
